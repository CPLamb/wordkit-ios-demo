					Wordnik's Objective-C SDK is a code library that you can drop into any iOS app to give it sophisticated lookup features based on the Wordnik API. It consists of two related pieces: 
					a UI SDK, which provides the interface elements for displaying Wordnik data within your app, 
					and a lower-level Data SDK, which helps your app communicate with the Wordnik API and on which 
					the UI SDK depends. The Data SDK can be used by itself in Mac OS apps. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Wordnik API behind the SDK provides traditional dictionary definitions from 
					multiple dictionaries, thesaurus data, and an enormous collection of example sentences. The 
					available example sentences are updated daily, meaning that unlike a traditional dictionary, 
					Wordnik will have examples of real-world use even for niche, slang, or recently-coined words. 
                </p>

                <h2>What can this do for you?</h2>
                <p>
                    Providing lookup information when and where your users need it will save them from having to shift their focus to look something upâ€”they quickly get the 
                    information they need from inside your app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the information is better than what they'll find anywhere else. Wordnik is the world's largest 
                    dictionary, with continually updated content.
                </p>

                <h2>Try It Out</h2>
                <p>
                    The app you're reading right now implements the full Wordnik iOS SDK. Select any word (if 
                    you can't decide try <strong>pants</strong>), and choose the 'Look up' option to view 
                    definitions, examples, and related words.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By following the steps outlined here and described in more detail in the documentation linked to 
                    below, developers can use the Wordnik iOS SDK to add these features to any iOS app.
