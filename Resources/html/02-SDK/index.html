                <h2>UI SDK</h2>
                <p>
                    The UI SDK works with iOS apps (<em>iPhone</em> or <em>iPad</em>) to provide lookup options for 
                    text selected within the app. When text is selected in an implementing app, a 'Look Up' option 
                    appears next to the standard copy/paste select options. When the 'Look Up' option is selected a 
                    window appears displaying:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Definitions</strong> of the selected word or words
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Thesaurus</strong> data such as synonyms and antonyms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Example sentences</strong> displaying real-world uses of the selected text
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- save this for the next rev, since personalized features might not be in first version
                <p>
                    In addition to dictionary lookup, the UI SDK provides the ability to mark words as 'favorites,' and 
                    to create word lists and add words to them. Users don't need to create a Wordnik account to use 
                    these features, though they have the option of doing so (or connecting the app to an existing 
                    Wordnik account), in which case favorites or lists created in an implementing app are visible when 
                    they log onto Wordnik.com.
                </p>
                -->

                <h2>Data SDK</h2>
                <p>
					The Data SDK is an intelligent and fully supported Objective-C wrapper around Wordnik's RESTful API. 
					It can be used with either iOS or Mac OS apps. The UI SDK relies on the Data SDK, but if you're 
					building a Mac OS app, or need to customize the UI of your iOS app beyond what is possible with 
					Wordnik's UI SDK, the Data SDK can be used on its own.  It supports API request batching, which 
					can significantly speed up access to the Wordnik API from mobile devices.
                </p>

                <h2>How It Works In Your App</h2>

                            When a word is looked up, you will see traditional
                            dictionary definitions where available, alongside example sentences and
                            thesaurus data (related words).

                            is either specific to the device, or to the Wordnik account of the user if they've logged 
                            in.

                            Wordnik's system using a unique device identifier, but no other personal information. That 
                            anonymous account can be claimed by a user and connected to a public Wordnik account at any 
                            later date.

					The UI SDK supports UIWebView, UITextView and can easily be used with custom UI controllers. 
					You can choose to enable lookup functionality on some or all of your text. See the iOS SDK
